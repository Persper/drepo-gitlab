# Illustrations

The illustrations should always align with topics and goals in specific context.

## Principles

#### Be simple.
- For clarity, we use simple and specific elements to create our illustrations.

#### Be optimistic.
- We are an open-minded, optimistic, and friendly team. We should reflect those values in our illustrations to connect with our brand experience.

#### Be gentle.
- Our illustrations assist users in understanding context and guide users in the right direction. Illustrations are supportive, so they should be obvious but not aggressive.


## Style

#### Shapes
- All illustrations are geometric rather than organic.
- The illustrations are made by circles, rectangles, squares, and triangles.

#### Stroke
- Standard border thickness: **4px**
- Depending on the situation, border thickness can be changed to **3px**. For example, when the illustration size is small, an illustration with 4px border thickness would look tight. In this case, the border thickness can be changed to 3px.
- We use **rounded caps** and **rounded corner**.

| Do | Don't |
| -------- | -------- |
| <img src="img/illustrations-caps-do.png" width= 133px alt="Do: caps and corner" /> | <img src="img/illustrations-caps-don't.png" width= 133px alt="Don't: caps and corner"/> |

#### Radius
- Standard corner radius: **10px**
- Depending on the situation, corner radius can be changed to **5px**. For example, when the illustration size is small, an illustration with 10px corner radius would be over-rounded. In this case, the corner radius can be changed to 5px.

#### Size
Depends on the situation, the illustration size can be the 3 types below:

**Large**

- Use case: Empty states, error pages (e.g. 404, 403).
- For vertical layout, the illustration should not larger than **430*300 px**.
- For horizontal layout, the illustration should not larger than **430*380 px**.

| Vertical layout | Horizontal layout |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| <img src="img/illustration-size-large-vertical.png" />  | <img src="img/illustration-size-large-horizontal.png" />

**Medium**

- Use case: Banner.
- The illustration should not larger than **240*160 px**.
- The illustration should keep simple and clear. We recommend not including too many elements in the medium size illustration.

**Small**

- Use case: Graphics for explanatory text, graphics for status.
- The illustration should not larger than **160*90 px**.
- The illustration should keep simple and clear. We recommend not including too many elements in the small size illustration.

**Illustration on mobile**

- Keep the proportions in original ratio.

#### Colors palette

For consistency, we recommend choosing colors from our color palette.

| Orange | Purple | Grey |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| <img src="img/illustrations-color-orange.png" width= 160px alt="Orange" /> | <img src="img/illustrations-color-purple.png" width= 160px alt="Purple" /> | <img src="img/illustrations-color-grey.png" width= 160px alt="Grey" /> |
| #FC6D26   | #6B4FBB | #EEEEEE |

#### Don't
- Don't include the typography in the illustration.
- Don't include tanuki in the illustration. If necessary, we recommend having tanuki monochromatic.
