# Releases

You can turn any git tag into a release, by adding a note to it.
Release notes behave like any other markdown form in GitLab so you can write text and drag-n-drop files to it.
Release notes are stored in the database of GitLab.

There are several ways to add release notes:

- In the interface, when you create a new git tag with GitLab.
- In the interface, by adding a note to an existing Git tag
- With the GitLab API.
