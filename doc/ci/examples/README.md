# GitLab CI/CD Examples

A collection of [`.gitlab-ci.yml` template files][gitlab-ci-templates] is maintained in GitLab. When you create a new file via the UI,
GitLab will give you the option to choose one of these templates.
If your favorite programming language or framework are missing we would love your
help by sending a merge request with a new `.gitlab-ci.yml` to this project.

There's also a collection of repositories with [example projects](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-examples) for various languages. You can fork and adjust them to your own needs.
