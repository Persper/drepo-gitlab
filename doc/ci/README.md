# GitLab Continuous Integration (GitLab CI/CD)

GitLab provides tools for continuously integrating and delivering code.

Within the [entire DevOps lifecycle](../README.md#the-entire-devops-lifecycle), GitLab CI/CD spans
the [Verify (CI)](../README.md#verify) and [Release (CD)](../README.md#release) stages.

## Overview

CI/CD is a vast area, so GitLab provides documentation for all levels of expertise. Consult the following table to find the right documentation for you:

| Level of expertise                  | Resource                                                                                                                                              |

## Introduction

The following introduces the process of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD):

![Pipeline graph](img/cicd_pipeline_infograph.png)

In this illustration:

- New code is combined with existing code through a commit to a project's [repository](../user/project/repository/index.md).
- The newly combined code is sent to a CI [pipeline](pipelines.md) where:
  - The code is [built](../user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.md).
  - Unit and integration tests are run over the built code.
- Assuming the build and tests are successful, a CD pipeline is triggered to allow for:
  - Review using [Review Apps](review_apps/index.md).
  - Deploying to configured [environments](environments.md).

The benefits of CI/CD are vast, allowing automation to be an integral part of your workflow for testing, building, deploying, and monitoring your code.

Because CI and CD with GitLab is broad topic with many possibilities, the rest of this section provides
links to topics and resources needed to make use of GitLab CI/CD.

## Essentials

The following documentation provides the minimum required knowledge for making use of GitLab CI/CD:

| Topic                                                                   | Description                                              |
|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| [Getting started with GitLab CI/CD](quick_start/README.md)              | Outlines the first steps for configuring GitLab CI/CD.   |
| [Introduction to pipelines and jobs](pipelines.md)                      | Provides an overview of GitLab CI/CD and jobs.           |
| [Configuration of your pipelines with `.gitlab-ci.yml`](yaml/README.md) | A comprehensive reference for the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. |

NOTE: **Note:**
Familiarity with [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is useful because it is
responsible for running the jobs in your CI/CD pipeline. On GitLab.com, shared Runners are enabled
by default so you don't need to set up anything to get started.

### Auto DevOps

An alternative to manually configuring CI/CD, GitLab supports [Auto DevOps](../topics/autodevops/index.md),
which:

- Provides simplified setup and execution of CI/CD.
- Allows GitLab to automatically detect, build, test, deploy, and monitor your applications.

## Basic usage

With basic knowledge of how GitLab CI/CD works, the following documentation extends your knowledge
into more features:

### GitLab Pages

GitLab CI/CD can be used to build and host static websites. For more information, see the
documentation on [GitLab Pages](../user/project/pages/index.md).

## Examples

Check out the [GitLab CI/CD examples](examples/README.md) for a collection of tutorials and guides on
setting up your CI/CD pipeline for various programming languages, frameworks, and operating systems.

## Administration

As a GitLab administrator, you can change the default behavior of GitLab CI/CD for:

- An [entire GitLab instance](../user/admin_area/settings/continuous_integration.md).
- Specific projects, using [pipelines settings](../user/project/pipelines/settings.md).

See also:

### Why GitLab CI/CD?

The following articles explain reasons why you might use GitLab CI/CD for your CI/CD infrastructure:

- [Why we chose GitLab CI for our CI/CD solution](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/17/gitlab-ci-oohlala/).
- [Building our web-app on GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/07/22/building-our-web-app-on-gitlab-ci/).

See also the [Why CI/CD?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OGgk2Tcxbpl7DJaIOzCX4Vqg3dlwfELC3u2jEeCBbDk) presentation.

## Breaking changes

As GitLab CI/CD has evolved, certain breaking changes have been necessary. These are:

- [CI variables renaming for GitLab 9.0](variables/README.md#gitlab-90-renaming). Read about the
  deprecated CI variables and what you should use for GitLab 9.0+.
- [New CI job permissions model](../user/project/new_ci_build_permissions_model.md).
  See what changed in GitLab 8.12 and how that affects your jobs.
  There's a new way to access your Git submodules and LFS objects in jobs.
