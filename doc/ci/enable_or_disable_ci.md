# How to enable or disable GitLab CI/CD

To effectively use GitLab CI/CD, you need a valid [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](yaml/README.md)
file present at the root directory of your project and a
[runner](runners/README.md) properly set up. You can read our
[quick start guide](quick_start/README.md) to get you started.

If you are using an external CI/CD server like Jenkins or Drone CI, it is advised
to disable GitLab CI/CD in order to not have any conflicts with the commits status
API.

GitLab CI/CD is exposed via the `/pipelines` and `/jobs` pages of a project.
Disabling GitLab CI/CD in a project does not delete any previous jobs.
In fact, the `/pipelines` and `/jobs` pages can still be accessed, although
it's hidden from the left sidebar menu.

GitLab CI/CD is enabled by default on new installations and can be disabled either
individually under each project's settings, or site-wide by modifying the
settings in `gitlab.yml` and `gitlab.rb` for source and Omnibus installations
respectively.

## Per-project user setting

The setting to enable or disable GitLab CI/CD can be found under your project's
**Settings > General > Permissions**. Choose one of "Disabled", "Only team members"
or "Everyone with access" and hit **Save changes** for the settings to take effect.

## Site-wide admin setting

You can disable GitLab CI/CD site-wide, by modifying the settings in `gitlab.yml`
and `gitlab.rb` for source and Omnibus installations respectively.

Two things to note:

1. Disabling GitLab CI/CD, will affect only newly-created projects. Projects that
   had it enabled prior to this modification, will work as before.
1. Even if you disable GitLab CI/CD, users will still be able to enable it in the
   project's settings.

For installations from source, open `gitlab.yml` with your editor and set
`builds` to `false`:

```yaml
## Default project features settings
default_projects_features:
  issues: true
  merge_requests: true
  wiki: true
  snippets: false
  builds: false
```

Save the file and restart GitLab: `sudo service gitlab restart`.

For Omnibus installations, edit `/etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb` and add the line:

```
gitlab_rails['gitlab_default_projects_features_builds'] = false
```

Save the file and reconfigure GitLab: `sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
