# Git documentation

Git is a [free and open source](https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source)
distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to
very large projects with speed and efficiency.

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) is a Git-based fully integrated platform for
software development. Besides Git's functionalities, GitLab has a lot of
powerful [features](https://about.gitlab.com/features/) to enhance your
[workflow](https://about.gitlab.com/2016/10/25/gitlab-workflow-an-overview/).

We've gathered some resources to help you to get the best from Git with GitLab.
