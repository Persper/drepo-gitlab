      # # Introduction - total running time
      #
      # The problem this module is trying to solve is finding the total running
      # time amongst all the jobs, excluding retries and pending (queue) time.
      # We could reduce this problem down to finding the union of periods.
      #
      # So each job would be represented as a `Period`, which consists of
      # `Period#first` as when the job started and `Period#last` as when the
      # job was finished. A simple example here would be:
      #
      # * A (1, 3)
      # * B (2, 4)
      # * C (6, 7)
      #
      # Here A begins from 1, and ends to 3. B begins from 2, and ends to 4.
      # C begins from 6, and ends to 7. Visually it could be viewed as:
      #
      #     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
      #        AAAAAAA
      #           BBBBBBB
      #                       CCCC
      #
      # The union of A, B, and C would be (1, 4) and (6, 7), therefore the
      # total running time should be:
      #
      #     (4 - 1) + (7 - 6) => 4
      #
      # # The Algorithm
      #
      # The algorithm used here for union would be described as follow.
      # First we make sure that all periods are sorted by `Period#first`.
      # Then we try to merge periods by iterating through the first period
      # to the last period. The goal would be merging all overlapped periods
      # so that in the end all the periods are discrete. When all periods
      # are discrete, we're free to just sum all the periods to get real
      # running time.
      #
      # Here we begin from A, and compare it to B. We could find that
      # before A ends, B already started. That is `B.first <= A.last`
      # that is `2 <= 3` which means A and B are overlapping!
      #
      # When we found that two periods are overlapping, we would need to merge
      # them into a new period and disregard the old periods. To make a new
      # period, we take `A.first` as the new first because remember? we sorted
      # them, so `A.first` must be smaller or equal to `B.first`. And we take
      # `[A.last, B.last].max` as the new last because we want whoever ended
      # later. This could be broken into two cases:
      #
      #     0  1  2  3  4
      #        AAAAAAA
      #           BBBBBBB
      #
      # Or:
      #
      #     0  1  2  3  4
      #        AAAAAAAAAA
      #           BBBB
      #
      # So that we need to take whoever ends later. Back to our example,
      # after merging and discard A and B it could be visually viewed as:
      #
      #     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
      #        DDDDDDDDDD
      #                       CCCC
      #
      # Now we could go on and compare the newly created D and the old C.
      # We could figure out that D and C are not overlapping by checking
      # `C.first <= D.last` is `false`. Therefore we need to keep both C
      # and D. The example would end here because there are no more jobs.
      #
      # After having the union of all periods, we just need to sum the length
      # of all periods to get total time.
      #
      #     (4 - 1) + (7 - 6) => 4
      #
      # That is 4 is the answer in the example.
