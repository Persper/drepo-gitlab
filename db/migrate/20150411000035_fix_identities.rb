    # Up until now, legacy 'ldap' references in the database were charitably
    # interpreted to point to the first LDAP server specified in the GitLab
    # configuration. So if the database said 'provider: ldap' but the first
    # LDAP server was called 'ldapmain', then we would try to interpret
    # 'provider: ldap' as if it said 'provider: ldapmain'. This migration (and
    # accompanying changes in the GitLab LDAP code) get rid of this complicated
    # behavior. Any database references to 'provider: ldap' get rewritten to
    # whatever the code would have interpreted it as, i.e. as a reference to
    # the first LDAP server specified in gitlab.yml / gitlab.rb.
