# This migration will create one row of NotificationSetting for each Member row
# It can take long time on big instances.
#
# This migration can be done online but with following effects:
# - during migration some users will receive notifications based on their global settings (project/group settings will be ignored)
# - its possible to get duplicate records for notification settings since we don't create uniq index yet
