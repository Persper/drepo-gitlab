# 20141121133009_add_timestamps_to_members.rb was meant to ensure that all
# rows in the members table had created_at and updated_at set, following an
# error in a previous migration. This failed to set all rows in at least one
# case: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/20568
#
# Why this happened is lost in the mists of time, so repeat the SQL query
# without speculation, just in case more than one person was affected.
