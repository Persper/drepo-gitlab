      You can generate a personal access token for each application you use that needs access to the GitLab API.
    %p
      You can also use personal access tokens to authenticate against Git over HTTP.
      They are the only accepted password when you have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) enabled.

      Feed token
    %p
      Your feed token is used to authenticate you when your RSS reader loads a personalized RSS feed or when when your calendar application loads a personalized calendar, and is included in those feed URLs.

      It cannot be used to access any other data.

      Keep this token secret. Anyone who gets ahold of it can read activity and issue RSS feeds or your calendar feed as if they were you.
